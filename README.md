# Stone-Paper-Scissor-Game

Rock, paper, scissors is a hand game where two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock, paper, or scissors. The game is governed by the following rules: 
Rock beats scissors: Rock is strong enough to break scissors. 
Scissors beats paper: Scissors can cut through paper. 
Paper beats rock: Paper wraps itself around the rock to lock it down. 
In theory, each option has an equal probability of winning. However, human tendencies can make the game unreliable. For example, winners may think that the option they won with will win them the game again, and losers may think that their option is worse and change their strategy. 
You can also play rock, paper, scissors against an artificial intelligence on Google Play. The game has 100 levels and 300 stars to collect.
